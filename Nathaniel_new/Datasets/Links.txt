Overview
- (1) has some python related links, I am happy for R, Python, or whatever software/packages
you feel most comfortable with to be used for the duration of the project.
- (2)(3)(4)(5) give you a sense of the underlying data.
- I've done a lot of preprocessing, so in the coming days (don't want to bombard you with too much information on day 1), I'll provide ye
  with a time series which combines (2)/(3)/(4)/(5) into a single time series. Ye can use this directly, or else write your own code
  to include/exclude variables that ye want to include in the model.
- I haven't included the bid-ask curve dataset, I can include that next week if someone is interested in applying the X-Model approach (one of the reference papers).


Things to Think about
What exactly am I trying to forecast?
What are the explanatory variables of interest? Do I include lagged values? How do I choose what variables to include/exclude (this is a research topic in its own right)?
What modelling approach will I try and mimic?
What data processing or transforms do I need to apply in order to be able to apply the model?
What about training/test sets, am I confident that the model isn't under/over fitting? What does the output look like?

2. DAMPrices -> the DAM market price. To recap, an auction occurs at 11am on day D. Then at circa 12pm on day D, the market operator publishes
24 prices, a price for each hour in the interval [11pm D, 10pm D+1]. Info available on SEMOpx. This is ultimately what we want to forecast.

3. BMInfo -> balancing market information. Please note that the data is patchy, this is because with the market go live the systems had issues
with this and other files as the entire software/process was new. Main thing of interest will be the balancing market price. It is for each 30 minute delivery
period. Information available on SEMO. This could be one of the exogenous explanatory variables.

4. WindForecast -> forecast system wind information. This could be one of the exogenous explanatory variables. The information is available via SEMO.
    		   Note: the info I am providing you with is not the raw underlying data file. I have done processing to ensure that we are only including data
                   that would be relevant for modelling.
                   For example, imagine it is 10:59am on day D. I want to forecast prices for every hour in the interval [11pm D, 10pm D+1]. The system wind forecast
		   gets updated throughout the day, but I am only interested in the wind forecast that covers the interval [11pm D, 10pm D+1] that is availabe at 10:59am on day D.
		   This is the information I provide in the file.

5. DemandForecast -> similar comments to (4), except we are dealing with forecast system demand/load.

6. AvailabilityProxy -> If it is 10>59am on day D, and I am about to submit an order to the DAM market, then I am interested in knowing what generators are/aren't available.
			This information is published in a couple of different places, but I have yet to source the official files (I've focused my attention on 10-15 of the most
			important files).
 			Hence, what I've done is construct the attached dataset which can be taken as a proxy for the availability.
			It shows the sell order volumes (in the dataset I don't indicate whether or not the orders were matched), by fuel type, for each hour.
			We'll need to be careful with how we use this dataset (I'll discuss the issue when I provide you with a copy of the combined timeseries datasets).
